# Darkspyre.Inference.Common

Shared, implementation-neutral contracts for in-process Tensor inference and out-of-process Connect
providers. The package contains semantic request, response, capability, progress, provenance, and
failure types. It does not select an implementation or provide automatic fallback between local and
external inference.

Applications choose an implementation explicitly and work with typed contracts:

```csharp
ILlmInference inference = connectProviders.Bind(connectionId);
LlmInferenceResult result = await inference.CompleteAsync(new LlmInferenceRequest
{
    ModelId = modelId,
    Messages = [new LlmMessage("user", prompt)]
}, cancellationToken);
```

The same `ILlmInference` and `IImageInference` contracts are implemented by the corresponding Tensor
packages. Rich provider-specific operations remain on their owning Connect APIs; Common is the
portable inference lane, not a least-common-denominator replacement for provider management.
